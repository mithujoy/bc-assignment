	<h3>1) What is your Understanding of Blockchain?</h3>
	<p>Ans: A blockchain is similar to a chain of blocks where the data is divided and stored into blocks are these blocks are interlinked to and also several copies of this blocks exist. This is a type of peer to peer based computing. In other words, blockchain a ledger of facts. It helps one achieve verifiability,data transparency, data integrity and decentralisation.</p>

	<h3>2) What is the core problem that the Blockchain is trying to solve?</h3>
	<p>Ans: The core problems that blockchain is trying to solve are:<br>
	i) Security <br>
	ii) Verifiabilty <br>
	iii) Authenticity</p>

	<h3>3) What are the few features that blockchain will give you ?</h3>
	<p> Ans: <br> i) Verifiablility <br>
	ii) Tamper Proof <br>
	iii) Decentralisation <br>
	iv) Immutable </p>

	<h3>4)What all things does blockchain contains ?</h3>
	<p>Ans: <br> i) The block number<br>
	ii) Transaction records (data or content)<br>
	iii) Signature of the previous block (SHA-256)<br>
	iv) Mining key</p>

	<h3>5)How is verifiability of blockchain is been attained ?</h3>
<p>Ans: The verifiability of blockchain can be achieved by the fingerprint of the block which is generated by the combination of data and the previous-block fingerprint, which is stored in the distributed systems.</p>
<p>
Ex:-
<pre>
Fingerprint(0) + Genesis Block = Fingerprint 1
Fingerprint 1 + Block_Data_2 = Fingerprint 2
Fingerprint 2 + Block_Data_3 = Fingerprint 3
Fingerprint 3 + Block_Data_4 = Fingerprint 4 and so on..
